# **The Environment Challenge**
### Edit
*This project folder is forked from another contributor.*

My role in this project was to create the functionality for our app and ensure all components could communicate efficiently and automatically. I was mainly in charge of the `App.js`, creating the functions my team members would use in their components. I came up with the methods to make our project function, how to utilise arrays, etc. I also wrote the `Home.js` component, which is the welcoming page for the application.

## **Overview**

The Environment Challenge is a mobile app developed by our team, **"Team Everest"**, using *JavaScript React, HTML, CSS* and *Bootstrap*.

**Team Everest** can be found in the contributors file [here](https://github.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

This project was a part of our module, **Mobile Application Development CS385**, in Maynooth University, National University of Ireland Maynooth. 
This module is worth 5 credits.

*React* version 18.2.0 (Date 07 FEB 24). 



This readme will provide an overview of the app's components and their functionality. The main concept of this project is to develop an application where a user is able to accept a wide variety of **environmentally friendly challenges**, that they are able to keep track of through the application , over a number of weeks, while the challenges increase in difficulty as you progress through them. 

## **Running the Software**

The app can be run in code-sandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/recent). Running the app will require the dependencies: `bootstrap.js` and `chart.js`.

## **Component Breakdown**

 The app's components are:
 
| `App.js` | `Home.js` | `ProfilePage.js` | `challenges.js` |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| `PointsChart.js` | `API.js` |    `index.js` |    `styles.js` |
 


 ## **App Component** 

The `App Component` consists of functionality to be used throughout all components. 
Data from the [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/main/code/BackUpAPI.js) is taken in as an array. A function called `changeStatus()` is used to update this array whilst being careful not to mess with the `useState`. 

The user can select the `Home` , `Profile` , `All Challenges` or `Stats` button from here.

The app hinges on the idea that every `'challenge'` has a **status**; `'null'`, `'in progress'`, or `'completed'`. 
Other functions include updating the current, weekly and all-time points the user has accumulated. This uses the idea of **'Write once, read many'** so that other components in the app need only be passed these functions by **props**, and this allows each component to communicate smoothly and update automatically.

## **Home Component** 

The `Home Component` contains the welcoming text for the app, explaining briefly what the app does and who it's aimed at. A few simple paragraphs to welcome the user and inform right away, this is the default page.

## **Challenges Component** 

The `Challenges Component` displays all the challenges from the data for the user, and has four sub-components. A top-bar menu displays button for the user, to select `Easy`, `Medium`, or `Hard` challenges using conditional rendering. 
![Challenges easy](https://github.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/blob/main/code/images/challenges.1.png?raw=true)

The `Medium` and `Hard` challenges are initially *locked*. The user must accumulate a number of points, before they become available. This is achieved by using conditional rendering to display the `Locked Challenges Component` should the `currentPointTotal` be below the required *threshold*. 

![Challenges locked](https://github.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/blob/main/code/images/challenges.2.png?raw=true)

Within each section, individual challenges with varying points are attached to them. The user can accept these challenges by clicking the add to `in progress button`, which changes the status to *‘in progress’*, and in turn displays them in the `InProgressBasket Component`, where they can be `Removed`, or `Marked as completed` with buttons.  

![Challenges inProgr](https://github.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/blob/main/code/images/challenges.3.png?raw=true)

The latter changes the status to *‘completed’*, which means they are then moved to the `CompletedBasket Component`. The user then gets a congratulatory message which is displayed in the `CompletedBasket component`. 

The buttons in the challenge sections change as the user goes through completing them, and become unclickable if they are already *in progress* or *completed*. 

A variable called `activeChall` uses a filter which takes only challenges that have a status of *‘in progress’*, and similarly, `completeChall` filters challenges with the status *‘completed’*. Properties of these two filtered arrays are used to populate both the `InProgressBasket`, and the `CompletedBasket`, and update as the data from the App is altered. There is also functionality for the user to empty their `‘in progress’ challenges`, or do a `‘weekly reset’` in the menu. The weekly 
reset uses the function from the main app to log that weeks points and set everything back to zero. 

When we have sufficient points accumulated we can see that the `Medium Challenges` are *unlocked*. You are now able to view the `Medium Challenges` that are available. This is the case for when the Hard Challenges are unlocked also.

## **Profile Page Component** 

The `ProfilePage Component` is for the user to see their *active* challenges and mark them as *completed* if they wish. It uses the same filtering function and the same `ActiveChall` and `CompleteChall` variables as in the `Challenges Component`.  

The *in progress* challenges are rendered into a table for the user to find **easily** and **quickly**. There is also buttons for clearing *active* challenges and for a `weekly reset`, allowing the user to access this functionality in multiple locations. 

When we *complete* challenges we can see that the accumulated points value (`currentPointTotal`) has risen. 

![ProfilePage Dispaly](https://github.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/blob/main/code/images/profilePage1.png?raw=true)

The profile page also contains the `Clear All Challenges` button, which will set all *active* challenges **status** to *null* from *in progress*. 

## **PointsChart Component**

The `PointsChart Component` allows the user to see their past progress through a chart that displays **weekly totals**. The user can see the trend of their **past four weeks**, as well as their **all-time point total**, taken from the main App. At the end of every week the user hits the `weekly reset` button to store their **points**. 

These four totals are *sliced* from the `weeklyPointTotal` array, and populates as the user continues to log more weeks.  

The user can also see the **highest weekly total** recorded as part of this section, and the `compareWeekTotal` variable is used to allow the user to see how they’re improving. These are both conditionally rendered. 

You can see here the user's **weekly scores** compared to one another.

As the **weekly totals** are updated the component destroys any existing charts, and instantiates another with the new information. Conditional rendering means that the chart only activates once the user has logged at least one week.

## **API Component**

Our API responds with JSON and we have a static JSON file for this. [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeclanDavis/TheEnvironmentChallengeApp/main/code/BackUpAPI.js)
Our JSON database contains *Challenges*, each with it's own unique `id`, `title` , `level` , `description` , `points` , `awarded` , `threshold` , `status` and  `tip`.

The development of a backend API was not a requirement of the project specification however our team agreed it was a strong strategy for our project.
